# React Search Result page

## Overview
 React basic search result page based upon a basic product API

 ## User story
React search result page with search bar and dynamic search parameter.  
The API staging endpoint as exposed by the Algolia search engine provides real data with a custom number of results ( 8 hitsPerPage ). 
Basic validation is applied which won't send any request to the search engine if no parament is provided as well as let users know if the parameter they are trying to search for isn't valid. 
Semantic UI library was used for a basic styling. 
Product information provided on the UI is : 
> - Product Name
> - Product description
> - SKU
> - UPS
